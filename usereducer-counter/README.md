## Part 1

1. Create a Counter component that increments, decrements and resets a count, implement this with useState
2. Create another component like step 1
3. Create another component that displays the sum of the 2 counter created above. Make the necessary adjustments to the previous 2 components created. Use the lifting states approach.
4. Bonus: Modify your code to use useContext to store the states and the 2 counters are consumers of the context
